      My name is Tom and I am a developer and an automation engineer who
      occasionally listens to some music
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working with three.js, typescript, react and aws lambda, just for
      fun I decided to create this website using vue
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also a musician and an avid listener, feel free to checkout my
      last.fm and watch out for my annual playlists on spotify!
